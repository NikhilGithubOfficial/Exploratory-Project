# Exploratory-Project
Solar Cell material prediction
Description : Exploratory project performed in group during the fourth semester of my college under the guidance of our professor Dr. Santanu Das.
Objective : In this project our main objective is to find the most suitable material by studying the the most important criteria .i.e the band gap.
Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers some insight into the materials used in the fabrication of solar cells , their properties and criterion for selection.
