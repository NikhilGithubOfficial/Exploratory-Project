# Exploratory-Project
Solar Cell material prediction<br/>
Description : Exploratory project performed in group during the fourth semester of my college under the guidance of our professor Dr. Santanu Das.<br/>
Objective : In this project our main objective is to find the most suitable material by studying the the most important criteria .i.e the band gap.<br/>
Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers some insight into the materials used in the fabrication of solar cells , their properties and criterion for selection.
